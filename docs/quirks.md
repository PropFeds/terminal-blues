# Quirks and Questions

## To work without branches

I use no extra branches, because image layers are easier to manage, and are sort of a form of source control.

## My Heavy and Light fonts are swapped

As of v118, Jeff's font listing in-game is swapped on those two when using a loaded tileset.
'Official' tilesets (ones that are included on compile) have the correct listing.

## My in-game colours are ugly

POWDER converts the palette into 5-bit RGB to be GBA compatible.
That's why the palette on the social cards and such looks different from in-game.

## Symbols that don't follow the roguelike semiotics (list unfinished)

- `#`   Boulders
- `░▒▓` Walls (`░` also for smoke)
- `⌂`   Potions
- `Θ`   Shields
- `♫`   Scrolls
- `x`   Spiders
- `ç`   Scorpions
- `o`   Slugs (*not* Oozes)
- `ö`   Orcs

## Turtles being qs and Qs is unusual

`quy` is how the letter `q` is pronounced in Vietnamese.

`quy` is also a Han-Viet (Chinese loan) word meaning `turtle`.
