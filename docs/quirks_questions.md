# Quirks and Questions

## The reason to post this on GitHub

It'll never be done. Please do give [feedback](../../readme.md#feedback).

## The decision to work without branches

I use no extra branches, because image layers are a form of source control anyway, and are easier to manage.

## The reason the Heavy and Light fonts are swapped

Jeff's font listing in-game is swapped on those two as of v118. Not even my fault.

## My in-game colours are ugly

POWDER converts the palette into 5-bit RGB to be GBA compatible. That's why the palette on the social cards and such looks different from in-game.

## What are all symbols that don't follow the roguelike semiotics? (list unfinished)

- `#`   Boulders
- `░▒▓` Walls (`░` also for smoke)
- `⌂`   Potions
- `Θ`   Shields
- `♫`   Scrolls
- `x`   Spiders
- `ç`   Scorpions
- `o`   Slugs (*not* Oozes)
- `ö`   Orcs

## Turtles being `q`s and `Q`s is unusual

`quy` is how the letter `q` is pronounced in Vietnamese.

`quy` is also a Han-Viet (Chinese loan) word meaning `turtle`.
