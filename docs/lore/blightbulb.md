# Blightbulb: Post-Mortem

Latest version: [0.03](../../fonts/blightbulb/blightbulb_gs_ro_0.03.png)

The original two inspirations for this were the Doves Type and Gabriola, neither of which really fit the vision (if there was one at all).

I'm still unsure what was going on with it.
Half slanted backwards, half straight, another half protruding forward (the f).
It's supposed to be somewhat handwriting-ish?
And then the extremely narrow width of it tells otherwise.

Its spacings had been adjusted (0.03) in Terminal Blues 1.1.0-alpha.1,
though it won't receive much update going forward.

Blightbulb would go to the extra list when Leafletter comes to replace,
but Leafletter will not likely be present on 1.1.0: Spelling Reform yet.
