# Blightbulb: The Post-Mortem

The original two inspirations for this were the Doves Type and Gabriola, neither of which really fit the vision (if there was one at all).

I'm still unsure what was going on with it.
Half slanted backwards, half straight, another half protruding forward (the f).
It's supposed to be somewhat handwriting-ish?
And then the extremely narrow width of it tells otherwise.

Its spacings had been adjusted in 1.1.0-alpha.1,
though it won't receive much update going forward.
My future plans for it would be to replace it with Leafletter Italics,
and yes, Leafletter will have two variants.

**The final listing would be:**

- Brass: eventually a new font
- Classic: the regular Shadow font (IBM CGA Thick)
- Heavy: Leafletter Regular
- Light: Leafletter Italics
- Shadow: the regular Heavy font, for the maximum readability, also nice font

And Blightbulb would go to the extra list.
Though, it will not likely be present on 1.1.0: Spelling Reform yet.

Also, Leafletter is a better pun!
