# True Blues: There's no True Blue

There's no one universal True Blue.
Everyone's Blue is different from one another.
The True Blues series of three aims to help those with colour deficiency
so that they can find their True Blues.

## Protea

Protanopia/Protanomaly

The First Guardian of the True Blue, the Bright

Protea is both the botanical name and the English common name of a genus of South African flowering plants, sometimes also called sugarbushes or fynbos.
In local tradition, the protea flower represents change and hope.
