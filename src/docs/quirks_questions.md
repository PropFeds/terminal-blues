# Quirks and Questions

### Why are you posting this on GitHub?
It'll never be done.

### Without branches?
I use no extra branches, because image layers are a form of source control anyway, and are easier to manage.

### Why are my in-game colours ugly?
POWDER converts the palette into 5-bit RGB to be GBA compatible. That's why the palette on the social cards and such looks different from in-game.

### What are all symbols that don't follow the roguelike semiotics ? (list unfinished)
- `#`   Boulders
- `░▒▓` Walls (`░` also for smoke)
- `⌂`   Potions
- `Θ`   Shields
- `♫`   Scrolls
- `x`   Spiders
- `ç`   Scorpions
- `o`   Slugs (*not* Oozes)
- `ö`   Orcs

### Why are turtles `q`s and `Q`s?
`quy` is how the letter `q` is pronounced in Vietnamese.

`quy` is also a Han-Viet (Chinese loan) word meaning `turtle`.
