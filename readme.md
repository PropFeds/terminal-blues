# Terminal Blues: A POWDER Tileset in CP437*
### By [PropFeds](https://deviantart.com/propfeds)

## Installation instructions:
**0.** Head to your favourite release and download.
Or clone the master to catch any work-in-progress changes.

**1.** Choose a variant folder:

    - blues: The regular Terminal Blues experience.

**2.** Install Terminal Blues:

    - Windows: Copy/cut the gfx folder inside the desired variant to your POWDER directory.
    
    - Linux: I don't have a Linux machine, however the process should be similar to Windows.
    
    - Handheld versions: You'll need to compile the game with these tiles included. No other way to apply this tileset.

**3.** Extra options: found inside each variant. Override the bmp files in the gfx folder inside POWDER directory to apply.

    - equipment: Will display worn equipment on the @ tile.

**4.** Don't forget to actually choose the tileset.
Start POWDER and go to Options > Tiles > From Disk.

*Some items have custom textures (HERESY!) for identification, and the spells are low-spec art with occasional CP437 character references.
