## by [PropFeds](https://deviantart.com/propfeds)
The Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring monsters and items as CP437 glyphs[*](#*Heresy:).

### Installation instructions:
**0.** Head to your favourite release and download, or clone the master to catch any work-in-progress changes. No extra branches, because image layers are a form of source control anyway.

**1.** Variants: Terminal Blues comes with at least one variant:
- blues: The regular Terminal Blues experience.

**2.** Install:
- Windows, Mac, Linux: Copy/cut the gfx folder inside the desired variant to your POWDER directory.
- Handheld versions: You'll need to compile the game with this tileset included.

**3.** Options: Found inside each variant. Override the bmp files in the gfx folder inside POWDER directory to apply.
- equipment: Will display worn equipment on the @ tile.

**4.** Apply: Within POWDER, go to Options > Tiles > From Disk.

**5.** Fonts: Custom fonts are available with the release. Head to Options > Fonts.
- Brass: Not really a custom font, but a different texture of a regular font.
- Classic: Replaced by Blightbulb, a self-made font.
- Heavy (listed in Options as Light, damn Jeff): Replaced by the font of Minecraft.

### *Heresy:
Some items have custom textures for identification, and the spells are low-spec art with occasional CP437 character references.
