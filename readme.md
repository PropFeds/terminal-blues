## by PropFeds
The Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring:
- Terrain, monsters and items in Code Page 437/Extended ASCII/ANSI[^1]
- (??? Heresy) Spell icons completely in 14px pixel-art
- Custom fonts: Head to Options > Fonts in-game to change the font.
    - Brass Blues: The Brass font with a new blue coat of paint.
    - Classic: Replaced by the font in Minecraft.
    - Light (listed in Options as Heavy, but [why?](docs/quirks_questions.md?#why-are-the-heavy-and-light-fonts-swapped): Replaced by Blightbulb, a custom font.

## Instructions (How to be Blue)
Head to your favourite release and download, or clone the master to catch any work-in-progress changes, as well as obtain the holy source of the tileset and extra content.

Terminal Blues comes with at least one variant:
- blues: The regular Terminal Blues experience.
- true_blues: Maybe a little bit different of an experience? Does not unlock any full terminal power.

On Windows, Mac, Linux:
- Create a folder in your POWDER directory named `gfx`.
- Copy the bmps in your desired variant to `gfx`.
- Some variants contain optional features. Override in `gfx` to apply.
    - equipment: Will display worn equipment on the @ tile.
- Within POWDER, go to Options > Tiles > From Disk.

On handheld versions: You'll need to compile the game with this tileset included.

## Feedback
Feedback is much appreciated. Either post an issue on GitHub, or head to `#powder` on the [roguelikes Discord](https://discord.gg/tJt4kMM), or now that I'm slightly braver I can self plug my [development guild](https://discord.gg/AxMZJyg) (`#slither-dither`).
