# Terminal Blues: A POWDER Tileset in CP437

## by [PropFeds](https://deviantart.com/propfeds)
Your Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring monsters and items as CP437* glyphs, as well as a few custom fonts.

### Installation instructions:
**0.** Head to your favourite release and download, or clone the master to catch any work-in-progress changes, because image layers are a form of source control anyway.

**1.** Choose a variant folder:
- blues: The regular Terminal Blues experience.

**2.** Install Terminal Blues:
- Windows, Mac, Linux: Copy/cut the gfx folder inside the desired variant to your POWDER directory.
- Handheld versions: You'll need to compile the game with this tileset included.

**3.** Extra options: found inside each variant. Override the bmp files in the gfx folder inside POWDER directory to apply.
- equipment: Will display worn equipment on the @ tile.

**4.** Apply the tileset by starting POWDER and go to Options > Tiles > From Disk.
