# Terminal Blues: A POWDER Tileset in CP437

## by PropFeds

The Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring:

- Terrain, monsters and items are entirely within Code Page 437[^1](#footnotes)
(or whatever you call it: extended ASCII, ANSI, etc.)
- (??? Heresy) Spell icons completely in 14px pixel-art
- Custom fonts: A very red Brass, plus [Blightbulb](extras/lore/blightbulb.md)
and [Eclipse](extras/lore/eclipse.md) to replace the
[Light and Heavy](docs/quirks.md#my-heavy-and-light-fonts-are-swapped) fonts!
- Questionable colourblind support
