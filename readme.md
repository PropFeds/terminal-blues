# Terminal Blues: A POWDER Tileset in CP437

## by PropFeds

The Hacklike reimagined in a deep blue terminal aesthetic. Featuring:

- Terrain, monsters and items in Code Page 437/Extended ASCII/ANSI[^1]
- (??? Heresy) Spell icons completely in 14px pixel-art
- Custom fonts: [Blightbulb](extras/lore/blightbulb.md) and [Eclipse](extras/lore/eclipse.md) to replace the [Light and Heavy](docs/quirks.md#my-heavy-and-light-fonts-are-swapped) fonts!
- Questionable colourblind support

who attempt to aid those with colour deficiencies.
